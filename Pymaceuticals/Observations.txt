Two observations I got from the graphics are:
1. At first I thought the tumors would have a similar behavior at the end of the 45 days because, with the first three graphs we observed a similar tendency
but at the end it was a completelly different resault so you can totally trust in what you see on graphics, yes it is helpfull but you need to analyze the numbers.
2. The survival behavior are the same for all treatments, it decreases. But something we can easily observe in the graphic is that survival rate decreases faster 
or slower in some tratments, it is very graphyc.
